			<p>
			“Engineering”, “Technology”, “Entrepreneurship”- such words were as foreign to me as was I to the United States, when I immigrated to this country from a small village in India at the age of 12. My teenage years were spent quickly learning English and catching up to the American education system, in addition to working up to three part-time jobs at a time to ensure that household bills would be paid. Working hard was not an optional, it was essential to the survival of my family and I.

			Nevertheless, I look back at the difficulties I was forced to overcome, and credit them for forcing me to become a resilient critical thinker and problem-solver. My sole enjoyment came from what became my passion: math, science, and technology. Transitioning from being raised in a third-world country to a first-world country like the United States, not only allowed me to fall in love with the benefits of these topics had, but also allowed me to dream of sharing these benefits universally.

			Outside of academics, I dedicate myself to maintaining and helping others maintain a healthy, positive lifestyle. My best days are spent mentoring others through CS or gym workouts, cooking exotic meals for family and friends, or outdoors playing sports like golf or football.
