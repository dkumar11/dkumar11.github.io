					“Engineering”, “Technology”, “Entrepreneurship”- such words were as foreign to me as was I to the United States, when I immigrated to this country from a small village in India at the age of 12. My teenage years were spent quickly learning English and catching up to the American education system, in addition to working up to three part-time jobs at a time to ensure that household bills would be paid. Working hard was not an optional, it was essential to the survival of my family and I. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Nevertheless, I look back at the difficulties I was forced to overcome, and credit them for forcing me to become a resilient critical thinker and problem-solver. My sole enjoyment came from what became my passion: math, science, and technology. Transitioning from being raised in a third-world country to a first-world country like the United States, not only allowed me to fall in love with the benefits of these topics had, but also allowed me to dream of sharing these benefits universally.
					</p>
					<p>
					Outside of academics, I dedicate myself to maintaining and helping others maintain a healthy, positive lifestyle. My best days are spent mentoring others through CS or gym workouts, cooking exotic meals for family and friends, or outdoors playing sports like golf or football.

Being a part of the EECS honors program and HKN Honors Society has showed me the power of empathetic leadership and definitely brought me out of my academic comfort zone.

						I was asked by the Director of the Engineering Student Services center to teach an accelerated version of CS61A for 30+ first-generation pre-Engineering incoming freshmen. Since none of the students had any past programming experience, I devoted many hours constructing discussion worksheets, content slides, labs and practice exams to help prepare them in all aspects so that they would enjoy the course and do well.

						In Summer 2016 I interned in San Francisco and conducted research under the National Science Foundation. In my research I worked on analyzing and characterizing a non-volatile retention flip-flop for data retention in sleep mode. By the end of my research internship, I maded tons of new friends, had a lot of great SF cuisines and developed a magnetic data retention flip-flop that was 3.6% faster, consumed 55% less power, and had 500% better sensing than pre-existing flip-flop.

						Two summer ago, I was selected by the EECS Division chair to conduct research on ultrafast magnetization of ferromagnetic allows through optically generated spin currents. The new technology I got to experiment with, the revolutionary findings that I had, and the mentors I made along the way easily made this the most interesting project I’ve ever worked on. My research allowed me to use spin currents to manipulate a 0.5-nanometer ferromagnetic layer and develop numerical simulations that compared temperature rises to calculate the spin currents in four different ferromagnetic metals (Fe, Ni, Co50Fe50, and Ni43Fe57). Furthermore, I developed MatLab simulations to model the magnetization dynamics of an adjacent ferromagnetic metal (Co50Fe50B) and constructed the model on a modified version of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.The result made a substantially positive in the field of Nanodevices, specifically in regards to the processing speed and data storage density since the current methods of controlling the magnetization dynamics of a ferromagnetic metal to store information contain substantial limitations.The caliber of my work gave me the chance to present my research at the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science national conference in Washington, DC.

						In my second semester at CAL I became a Computer Science Mentor and lead a discussion session for a small group of CS61A students. As a mentor, my responsibilities were to teach construct and teach a lesson every week that summarized the material taught in class, facilitate a discussion worksheet, and clarify any questions or confusing subject matter. Out of all my teaching experiences this was definitely one of the most rewarding.
